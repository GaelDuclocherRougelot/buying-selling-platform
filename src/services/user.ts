 * Deletes a user account and related data from the database.

 * This function performs the following actions:
 * 1. Deletes all records from the "account" table associated with the given user ID.
 * 2. Deletes all records from the "session" table associated with the given user ID.
 * 3. Performs a soft delete on the user by setting the "deletedAt" field to the current timestamp
 *    in the "user" table. The user's data remains in the database for 12 months before being permanently deleted.
 *
 * @param userId - The unique identifier of the user to delete.
 * @returns The updated user record after the soft delete operation.
 * @throws Will throw an error if the user is not found or has already been deleted.
